## How to Use

   - Start any training module

2. **Activate the Extension**
   - Click on the GoEthena Auto Clicker extension icon in your toolbar
   - Click "Start Auto Clicker" button
   - You'll see a green indicator appear on the page showing "GoEthena Auto Clicker Active"

3. **Let it Work**

     - Scroll down to reveal content
     - Click "Continue" buttons when they appear

## How It Works

The extension runs in the background and continuously:

1. **Looks for Continue buttons** - Searches for buttons containing "Continue", "Next", or similar text
2. **Finds answer options** - Identifies clickable elements that start with "A.", "B.", "C.", "D.", etc.
3. **Clicks systematically** - Clicks one answer option at a time with delays between clicks
4. **Submits answers** - Finds and clicks "Submit Answer" buttons
5. **Scrolls when needed** - Scrolls down to reveal more content when no clickable elements are found

## Timing and Delays

- **Scroll Speed**: 1 second between scroll attempts
- **Click Delay**: 2 seconds between clicks
- These delays help ensure the page has time to load and respond

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Make sure you're on `app.goethena.com`
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### No Buttons Being Clicked
- The extension might not recognize the button format
- Try manually scrolling to see if buttons become visible
- Check the browser console (F12) for error messages

### Extension Stops Working
- Refresh the page
- Disable and re-enable the extension
- Reload the extension from `chrome://extensions/`

## Customization

You can modify the timing by editing `content.js`:

```javascript
this.scrollSpeed = 1000; // milliseconds between scrolls
this.clickDelay = 2000;  // milliseconds between clicks
```

## Safety Notes

- This extension only works on `app.goethena.com` for security
- It will only click on recognized answer patterns
- The extension adds visual feedback so you know when it's active
- You can stop it at any time using the popup interface
